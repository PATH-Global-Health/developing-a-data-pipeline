The hospitalization and population data have some missingness, and the death data are almost completely missing. While it’s not obvious from summary() , there’s also missingness in the region variable, which we can see using colSums(is.na()), a count of missing observations for each variable.\nsummary(malaria_dat) #Review data\n\n     uid               region               year          cases      \n Length:25          Length:25          Min.   :2015   Min.   : 23.0  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:2016   1st Qu.: 56.0  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :2017   Median :111.0  \n                                       Mean   :2017   Mean   :111.2  \n                                       3rd Qu.:2018   3rd Qu.:162.0  \n                                       Max.   :2019   Max.   :197.0  \n                                                                     \n      hosp            deaths        pop      \n Min.   : 2.000   Min.   :1    Min.   :1039  \n 1st Qu.: 4.000   1st Qu.:1    1st Qu.:1052  \n Median : 5.500   Median :1    Median :2042  \n Mean   : 5.667   Mean   :1    Mean   :3739  \n 3rd Qu.: 8.000   3rd Qu.:1    3rd Qu.:4730  \n Max.   :10.000   Max.   :1    Max.   :9832  \n NA's   :1        NA's   :18   NA's   :5     \n\ncolSums(is.na(malaria_dat)) #Review missingness counts in each column\n\n   uid region   year  cases   hosp deaths    pop \n     0      5      0      0      1     18      5",

    "text": "2.2 NAs or zeroes?\nAs noted above, the death data are mostly NA, the hospitalization data contain an NA, and there are no zero values in the data set. Once we’ve confirmed that zeroes are stored as NAs (by asking a knowledgeable source), we need to figure out which NAs were likely reported zeroes and which non-reporting. Let’s review the data more carefully by creating time series plots for each facility. We’ll depict missing hospitalizations in red.\n\nggplot(malaria_dat) +\n  geom_point(data = . %&gt;% filter(is.na(hosp)), aes(x = year, y = -3), color = \"red\") +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = cases, color = \"cases\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = hosp, color = \"hospitalizations\")) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = deaths, color = \"deaths\")) +\n  ggforce::facet_wrap_paginate(.~uid) +\n  labs(y = NULL)\n\nWarning: Removed 18 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we know that hospitalization and death data are reported together, we may be able to assume that facilities actually reported zero deaths, i.e., that the data are not missing, so long as the facilities reported malaria hospitalizations that year. In our example, that would mean we set all deaths to zero except for at LJn8gzrq2 in 2017, when hospitalization and death data were both missing.\nAt health facilities that rarely see hospitalizations or deaths, you might assume NAs for both indicators are zeroes. However, at a facility like LJn8gzrq2, where hospitalizations are regularly recorded in low numbers, you might not. What would you do in this instance? Missing data assumptions are often a judgement call. Getting someone’s thoughts who is familiar with the context is always a good idea and can help you refine your assumptions.\nIn you own work, your data will likely include additional data elements. You may be able to create a rule, such as, “If the number all-cause admissions (or malaria tests) is greater than 0 in a given month, assume the number of malaria admissions is actually zero if NA.” Similarly, for outpatient data, if the number of tests administered is greater than zero but cases are NA, you may be able to assume there were zero confirmed cases. Whatever you assume, be sure to confirm your assumptions are reasonable with someone who’s familiar with the context, and state your assumptions when reporting.",

    "text": "2.3 Different levels of completeness in numerators and denominators\nMissingness can significantly impact our findings, so it’s important to account for it before we summarize, model, or report data. One of the most common problems we encounter with missing data arises when we evaluate incidence rates. Often, facility data is missing case counts or a catchment population estimate, but not necessarily both. If we calculate a region (or district)-wide incidence rate, our estimate might be substantially off if several facilities don’t have both population estimates and case counts.\nIn our data set, facility Hnd7FjkO9 is missing population data. We can calculate incidence rates for Central region, both including and excluding this facility. First, we’ll subset our data to Central. Then, we’ll calculate the 5-year annualized (average) incidence rate per 1000, including 1) all facilities and 2) only facilities with complete case and population data.\n\nmalaria_dat_central = malaria_dat %&gt;%\n  filter(region==\"Central\")\n\nmalaria_dat_central %&gt;% #Calculate incidence using data from facilities with missing data\n  summarise(incidence = sum(cases, na.rm = T)/sum(pop, na.rm = T)*1000/5) #Ignore NAs\n\n  incidence\n1  36.36364\n\nmalaria_dat_central %&gt;% #Calculate incidence using data from facilities removing rows with missing data\n  filter(!is.na(cases), !is.na(pop)) %&gt;%\n  summarise(incidence = sum(cases, na.rm = T)/sum(pop, na.rm = T)*1000/5) #Divide by 5 to annualize.\n\n  incidence\n1  16.89394\n\n\nIf we include all facilities, the incidence rate is over 2 times higher than if we restrict to facilities with complete data. This is because in the first instance, we’ve considered all cases in the Region while only considering the population residing in one of two catchment areas, i.e., our numerator and denominator don’t cover the same areas. In the second instance, the numerator and denominator do cover the same area. It’s generally best to restrict to observations where data are complete when calculating summaries (or regression modeling). However, in our example, we’d end up removing 50% of facilities!\nBefore you throw out half your data, consider your alternatives. Can you use a regional population estimate that’s reported elsewhere for the denominator instead of using the sum of the facilities’ catchment populations? Do you have access to population data for Hnd7FjkO9 for a different year, perhaps 2020, that you can use to create estimates for earlier years? Is it possible that you can report cases instead of incidence rates?",

    "text": "2.4 Restricting data based on completeness\nYou may find yourself in a situation where your data is largely missing and there isn’t much you can do. When this occurs, summarizing your data or making wider inferences about epidemiological patterns may not be appropriate. While we can calculate an incidence rate for Central Region with only one facility, we probably shouldn’t. It’s possible that the missing facility may serve most of the region’s population and have different trends from the facility with complete data, leading us to misestimate incidence for the region.\nIt’s common to set a threshold for how much missingness you’re willing to accept. For example, many people exclude all facilities that don’t report data during at least 80% of the follow-up period. Similarly, you might not create district or regional summaries without data from at least 80% of facilities. As before, the decisions you make are judgement calls and should be informed by the specific questions you’re trying to answer and any relevant contextual information.",

Which facility-years were you unable to calculate rates for, and why? Could you make different assumptions that would allow you to calculate rates for these years?\nExercise 2. Replace the case and hospitalization variables in your data using the following code: set.seed(0) then malaria_dat2 = malaria_dat %&gt;% group_by(uid) %&gt;% mutate(cases =round(rnorm(5, cur_group_id()^2*30, sd = cur_group_id()^2*10)), hosp = round(rnorm(5, mean(cases)/33, sd = sd(cases/33)))) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% mutate(hosp = ifelse(row_number() %in% c(1,7,9,13,16,22,25), NA, hosp)). Review the new data, and create a rule for setting hospitalizations and deaths to zero. What assumptions did you make? Recode suspected zeroes as zero.\nExercise 3. You’ve discovered that the 2020 population for facility Hnd7FjkO9 is 15,000 and has been growing 2.6% annually. Calculate the population estimates for 2015 through 2019, then calculate the annual incidence rates for Central Region.",
